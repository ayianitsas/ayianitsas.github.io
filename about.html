            <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
            <p>I am expecting to graduate from OU in December of 2024 with a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) and a minor in Psychology. As I approach the end of my undergraduate career, I am excited to embark on my journey in the professional world, where I can combine my technical expertise with insights into human behavior to create innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>My coursework in MIS has provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, systems design, and project management, while my studies in psychology have enhanced my understanding of human motivation, decision-making, and communication. This unique combination of skills positions me to thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments where technology and people intersect. I am eager to apply my education to real-world challenges, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>
